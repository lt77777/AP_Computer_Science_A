 * Ask the user how many players are on their ping-pong team. (Error check with a while loop: minimum of 5 players.) Then, using another while loop,

ex: How many wins does player # 3 have? 
When finished, display the average # of wins, the most wins, the least wins, and how many double-digit wins there are.
